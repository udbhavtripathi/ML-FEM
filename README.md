# ML-FEM
In this project I with other two project members developed the ML-model for the prediction of Stress and deformation on a 3-D cantilever beam. This will accelerate the product development workflow by dramatically reducing the speed of FEM analysis.

Objective:

Accelerate the product development workflow by dramatically reducing the need for prototyping or iterative testing.
Prediction of Stress and deflection for a given model and load.
Method:

FEM
Machine Learning
Ansys Software
Automation (Python)
